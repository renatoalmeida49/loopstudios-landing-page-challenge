## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was really nice to split up the CSS Rules from the ```style.css``` into little pieces of files, where each one has rules from a section of the page. This makes the files more organized and simplify the media queries.
### Continued development

There is a little correction it has to be done in the menu mobile. The close button it's not well placed.

Also the hover effects in the cards makes the reading a little difficult.
